# Website Editorial EU - Next.js

This is a Next.js project created to convert the static website from [website-editorial-eu-static](https://github.com/raimonvibe/website-editorial-eu-static) into a modern, modular Next.js application.

## Project Structure

### Pages (12 total)
- Homepage (`/`)
- About (`/about`)
- Certificates (`/certificates`)
- Clients (`/clients`)
- Contact (`/contact`)
- Legal Notice (`/legalnotice`)
- 3D Models (`/models`)
- Opportunities (`/opportunities`)
- Privacy Notice (`/privacynotice`)
- Projects (`/projects`)
- Resume (`/resume`)
- Services (`/services`)
- Sidebar Projects (`/sidebar-projects`)

### Shared Components
- **Header**: Logo and social media icons
- **Sidebar**: Navigation menu, search, and project links
- **SidebarProjects**: Dedicated component for project showcase
- **Footer**: Copyright and attribution links

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Eliminates duplicate code through reusable components
- **Next.js App Router**: Modern routing with TypeScript support
- **Static Export**: Configured for static site generation
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and structured data

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a static export in the `out/` directory.

## Development Notes

This project structure was designed to:
1. Convert 12 HTML pages to Next.js TSX components
2. Extract shared elements (sidebar, header, footer) into reusable components
3. Separate the projects section into its own component and page
4. Maintain the original design while improving code maintainability
5. Enable easy future enhancements and content management
